					16,000 golf courses call the United States home (that's 45% of the global amount of courses). The average golf course occupies around 74 acres of land (3,223,440 ft2), which is terraformed to a monoculture and meticulously maintained by groundskeeping staff. <br /> <br />

					This is 74 acres of land that is completely stripped of its natural inhabitants, plowed, and planted over with close-clipped, shiny, green grass. Because the land is privately owned and funded, the local or national government gets little to no say in how that land is regulated. This means as long as the owners of the land have the funds to do so, all of the land can be terraformed and subsequently maintained to the owner’s liking.

					<br /> <br /> The beautiful, bountiful natural biodiversity of forests or plains is replanted with lawn grass. While golf courses are conscious of what grass grows better in which regional soils across the United States, it doesn’t stop grass from being a surface to putt on.
