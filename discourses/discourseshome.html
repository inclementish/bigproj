				Golf courses are a plague that seem to passively pervade the continental United States. <br /> <br />

				A large building arises, gleaming with white paint, from some hill and soon a rash of green, manicured lawn traipses its way through the countryside. Those who can afford to pay indulgences flock to be accepted into the newly developed country club upon said hill. The poor laity who cannot afford entrance are now both literally and figuratively below those on the inside. <br /> <br />

				Destroying acres of ecosystem to use copious resources and profuse manual labor to maintain playgrounds for the rich is something in the U.S. that should not be tolerated to the level it is. The land would be better suited for anything else: from being left to prosper in its original state to housing publicly-accessible programs or amenities in order to foster a less elite, exclusionist community. <br />
