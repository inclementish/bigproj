					In the years following the American Revolution, the United States slowly developed into a hub for the financial elite. However, unlike the rich of European powers, those well off in the U.S. were business moguls who found their homes in urban settings and their money in manufacturing and industrialization. <br /> <br />

					After the American Civil War and subsequent spread of industrialization to places outside the eastern seaboard. The government saw the increased land availability as ripe for appropriating, and the financially elite wanted to finally display their wealth and interact with those like them. <br /> <br />

					In the past, country clubs were more elite and exclusionary than they are today. Given that, historically, country clubs have excluded people who are Black, Jewish, and even Catholic (not to mention those who are Latine and Native American), it isn't suprising to see this exclusionary mentality carried forward.
