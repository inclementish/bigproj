					Country clubs being ran the same as they are currently run in the U.S. perpetuates white elitism and validates the exclusion of poor people and people of color from activities and settings that are seen as “refined” or “in good taste”. <br /> <br />

					This is 74 acres of land that is completely stripped of its natural inhabitants, plowed, and planted over with close-clipped, shiny, green grass. Because the land is privately owned and funded by the rich paying their indulgences to keep the grounds running, the local or national government gets little to no say in how that land is regulated. <br /> <br />

					This means as long as the owners of the land have the funds to do so, all of the land can be terraformed and subsequently maintained to the owner’s liking.
